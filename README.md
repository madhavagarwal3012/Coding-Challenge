# Coding Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the Python Coding Challenge! This program is designed to process a list of integers based on specific criteria. The program performs the following tasks:

1. **Input**: Accepts a list of integers provided by the user.

2. **Validation**: Checks if the length of the input list is a multiple of 10. If not, it emits an error message, indicating that the input list length must be a multiple of 10.

3. **Processing**: Removes items at positions that are multiples of both 2 and 3 from the input list.

4. **Output**: Returns or prints the modified list of integers.
